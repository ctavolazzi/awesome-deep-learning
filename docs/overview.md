# Repository Overview

This repository currently consists of a single curated README listing deep learning learning resources across topics such as books, courses, tutorials, papers, researchers, datasets, frameworks, and tools. The README follows the familiar "awesome" list structure with Markdown headings and numbered or bulleted lists of links.

## Key Takeaways

- **Primary content** – `README.md` contains the entire curated catalogue. There is no executable code, configuration, or supporting assets beyond this document.
- **Structure** – Content is organized into topical sections (Books, Courses, Videos and Lectures, etc.) linked from a table of contents at the top of the README.
- **Maintenance** – Contributions are encouraged through pull requests that add new resources under the appropriate section.

## Getting Started

Because the project is documentation-only, there are no build steps or test suites to run. Familiarity simply involves browsing the sections in `README.md` and following links to external resources of interest.
