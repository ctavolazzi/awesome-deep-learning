# Repository Overview

This repository curates deep-learning resources and now also offers a small
hands-on demo you can run locally.

## Key Takeaways

- **Primary content** – `README.md` contains the curated catalogue of books,
  courses, tutorials, papers, researchers, datasets, frameworks, tools, and more.
- **Structure** – Content is organized into topical sections linked from a table
  of contents at the top of the README.
- **Interactive demo** – The `examples/digit-classifier` folder contains a
  scikit-learn powered sample project that trains a neural network on the digits
  dataset and writes an artifact bundle (`metrics.json`, `run_summary.json`,
  `predictions.json`, `loss_curve.json`, `sample_gallery.png`,
  `confusion_matrix.png`). A companion `web_demo/` subfolder reads those
  artifacts directly, maintains a historical `index.json`, and exposes a
  selector so the dashboard reflects whichever run you choose—latest by default.

## Getting Started

- **Browse resources** – Explore the sections in `README.md` and follow links to
  external references.
- **Run the demo** – Follow `examples/digit-classifier/README.md` to create a
  virtual environment, install dependencies, and execute the demonstration
  script. The script outputs both console metrics and JSON/PNG artifacts that
  illustrate a typical deep-learning workflow on a manageable dataset. Launch
  the static dashboard in `examples/digit-classifier/web_demo/` to browse
  up-to-date samples, inspect model diagnostics, and review experiment notes
  directly in your browser—the page auto-loads the artifacts generated by the
  Python run.
- **No dependencies? No problem** – Need a quick preview without installing
  `scikit-learn`? Run
  `examples/digit-classifier/web_demo/seed_sample_artifacts.py` to generate a
  curated artifact bundle that mirrors real output so the dashboard remains
  interactive in restricted environments.

## Planning the MVP

- **Vision snapshot** – `docs/mvp_plan.md` captures the product framing,
  capabilities, and technical requirements for the first releasable milestone of
  the digit-classifier experience.
- **Development focus** – Prioritize wiring the Python artifacts and dashboard
  contract, tightening documentation, and adding light automation to reach a
  polished MVP before expanding scope.
- **Release readiness** – Before sharing changes, walk through
  [`docs/release_checklist.md`](release_checklist.md) to regenerate artifacts,
  rerun smoke tests, and grab a fresh dashboard preview for reviewers.
This repository currently consists of a single curated README listing deep learning learning resources across topics such as books, courses, tutorials, papers, researchers, datasets, frameworks, and tools. The README follows the familiar "awesome" list structure with Markdown headings and numbered or bulleted lists of links.

## Key Takeaways

- **Primary content** – `README.md` contains the entire curated catalogue. There is no executable code, configuration, or supporting assets beyond this document.
- **Structure** – Content is organized into topical sections (Books, Courses, Videos and Lectures, etc.) linked from a table of contents at the top of the README.
- **Maintenance** – Contributions are encouraged through pull requests that add new resources under the appropriate section.

## Getting Started

Because the project is documentation-only, there are no build steps or test suites to run. Familiarity simply involves browsing the sections in `README.md` and following links to external resources of interest.
