# Digit Classifier MVP Dossier

## Executive Summary
The digit-classifier MVP delivers an end-to-end workflow that trains a softmax regression model on the scikit-learn digits dataset, exports a structured artifact suite, and powers a static dashboard for rapid inspection without depending on heavyweight infrastructure.【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L1-L58】 The implementation keeps dependencies to NumPy, Pillow, and scikit-learn, making the demo easy to reproduce in lightweight environments while still showcasing a complete ML-to-visualization loop.【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L9-L20】

## Target Users and Goals
The example is tailored to practitioners or educators who need a compact demonstration of modern ML hygiene: reproducible training, documented artifacts, and dashboard-ready outputs that can be refreshed after each run.【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L21-L187】 The MVP emphasises clarity over scale so teams can iterate on experimentation practices before investing in full experiment tracking stacks.【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L3-L8】

## Training Pipeline Architecture
`run_demo.py` centralises default hyperparameters, CLI parsing, and optional JSON configuration overrides so that a single entry point can cover interactive tinkering and scripted execution.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L48-L139】【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L399-L429】 The script performs a stratified train/validation/test split, then learns feature normalisation statistics on the training split and reapplies them to held-out data to avoid leakage.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L432-L468】 Training uses mini-batch gradient descent with a numerically stable softmax, capturing per-epoch loss and accuracy metrics for both training and validation sets.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L142-L221】 After convergence, the model scores the test split and generates a qualitative gallery image that highlights correct and incorrect predictions.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L471-L504】

## Configuration and Reproducibility
Default arguments (epochs, batch size, learning rate, seed, output directory) can be overridden via CLI flags or by supplying a JSON config file that mirrors the available options, enabling teams to share repeatable recipes.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L48-L139】【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L29-L45】【F:examples/digit-classifier/config.example.json†L1-L8】 Run names default to a timestamped identifier but can be pinned for downstream automation, and all randomness is controlled through a single seed to keep splits, shuffles, and weight initialisation deterministic.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L112-L139】【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L437-L439】

## Artifact Suite
The training command emits metrics, per-sample predictions, loss curves, metadata, and a gallery image into the requested output directory so the dashboard and downstream tools can consume structured results.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L269-L349】【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L46-L75】 Metadata records dataset dimensions, training configuration, artifact paths, and the learned normalisation statistics (method, source, per-feature mean/std) to guarantee the preprocessing steps are reproducible.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L320-L342】【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L71-L152】 All JSON payloads are validated before being written, ensuring schema stability for the UI.【F:examples/digit-classifier/run_demo.py†L352-L370】

## Dashboard Implementation
The web demo reads artifact locations from `data-*` attributes, disables HTTP caching, and fetches all JSON files in parallel via `fetch()`, surfacing load status to the user.【F:examples/digit-classifier/web_demo/script.js†L1-L245】 Metrics, loss curves, metadata, and predictions are rendered dynamically with graceful fallbacks when data is missing, truncated tables for large sample sets, and highlighting of misclassified digits.【F:examples/digit-classifier/web_demo/script.js†L42-L218】 The dashboard also exposes raw metadata JSON for inspection, making it simple to verify configuration and normalisation details straight from the browser.【F:examples/digit-classifier/web_demo/script.js†L117-L145】

## Validation and Testing
Schema helpers enforce the expected structure, types, and lengths for each artifact, including strict checks that normalisation statistics match the dataset dimensionality and that probability vectors align with the declared class count.【F:examples/digit-classifier/artifact_schemas.py†L1-L200】 A regression test exercises the full pipeline in a temporary directory, validates every artifact against the shared schemas, asserts key metadata fields (such as normalisation method and run name), and confirms the gallery image is produced; the suite skips automatically when scikit-learn is unavailable so lightweight CI environments remain green.【F:tests/test_digit_classifier_artifacts.py†L1-L90】

## Operational Workflow
The README documents a rinse-and-repeat workflow for regenerating artifacts, copying them next to the dashboard assets, serving the directory with a static server, and refreshing the browser to pick up the latest run thanks to cache-busting requests.【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L154-L187】 Running `python -m unittest tests.test_digit_classifier_artifacts` provides automated assurance of artifact integrity, while `python -m compileall` can be used as a quick syntax smoke test during development.【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L188-L200】【F:tests/test_digit_classifier_artifacts.py†L33-L87】

## Future Considerations
With the MVP in place, natural follow-ups include enriching the dashboard with charts or pagination once prediction sets grow, extending schema validators to cover additional artifact types, and layering more automation (e.g., Makefile targets) as team workflows mature—building on the reproducible foundation already documented in the example.【F:examples/digit-classifier/README.md†L46-L200】【F:examples/digit-classifier/web_demo/script.js†L1-L259】
